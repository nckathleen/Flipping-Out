# Flipping Out!

## Coin Flip Project

We have created a program that simulates coin flips and then documents the results.

We began by flipping a coin a specified number of times, recording the number of flips, as well as the number of heads and tails results at different intervals.  

We then plotted the difference between heads and tails results, as well as the ration of heads results to total flips.

To run the program, you must make sure the contents of requirements.txt have been installed in the folder from which you will be running the program.

To download the contents of requirements.txt, you  will enter:

    'pip install -r requirements.txt'

at the command line of the same folder.  Ipython notebook is also required to run the program and see the plotted results.  Type ipython notebook at the command line.

    ipython notebook

Once in the notebook, click on Flipping Out and see the magic!
