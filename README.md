# Flipping Out!

## Coin Flip Project

We have created a program that simulates coin flips and then documents the results.

We began by flipping a coin a specified number of times, recording the number of flips, as well as the number of heads and tails results at different intervals.  

We then plotted the difference between heads and tails results, as well as the ration of heads results to total flips.
